摘要：In a hacker forum and constructs four user profiles based on the observed behavior patterns.我认为这种结合数据，来为论坛中用户划分profile的过程，
本质上很类似于project里面，结合用户的数据，来对用户进行segmentation。这一类在零售公司里很常见，但似乎在网络和论坛用户中少见，我希望能够研究一下小说和文娱方面的用户
segmentation。
文章分类的四种hacker：guru hackers, casual hackers, learning hackers, and novice hackers

Guru hackers are knowledgeable and respectable. They usually share ideas and advice with others. 第一层级，给建议。
Casual hackers tend to act as observers. They can be skilled hackers who show interest mainly in deriving usable information from the 
forum. 第二层级，观察整合。
Learning hackers are also expert hackers who utilize the forum basically for learning. They actively seek knowledge and tend to share more of it over
time. 第三层级 学习者
Novice hackers are new learners who typically join the forum for a short period. 第四层级 过客。
【这里放到娱乐的社群也是一样的概念：第一层 创作者。第二层 各类bot整合推广。第三层 热爱者。第四层 随便看看。】
Overall, it is found that hacker communities very much represent learning communities where meritocracy(精英体制？感觉更像是一种等级) is in place.

Hacker . Hacker profile . Knowledge transfer .Online learning . Hacker ecosystem

Studies have found that acquiring knowledge is a primary motivation many individuals to engage in hacking. 
All this suggests that knowledge transfer in the form of knowledge provision or knowledge seeking plays an important role in identifying hackers.
这里对于展示论文研究原因的部分，很值得重视。承上启下，点名因为hack让大家遭受日益损失，那么我们就需要一些特征帮助我们有效识别hacker。这里点出来，知识的传递是重点。

By contrast, most available hacker categorizations in the literature are based essentially on skills, intentions and motivations 
(Rogers 2006; Barber 2001; Pipkin 2003). 
As a result, the classifications have painted rather static pictures, 
where a hacker is someone possessing certain skillsets with either malicious or benign intentions.
现有的研究对于黑客的分类太僵化，黑客就是技能 +善意/恶意。
